# Fun with AI

"OpenAIâ€™s API provides access to GPT-3, which performs a wide variety of natural language tasks, and Codex, which translates natural language to code." - [OpenAI](https://openai.com/api/)

Using OpenAI's API, this web app accepts a prompt and returns a response related to the prompt. Responses are saved through local storage. An account with an API key from OpenAI is necessary if this project is cloned.
